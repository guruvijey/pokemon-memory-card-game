# pokemon-memory-card-game

A simple memory card game featuring pokemon where the game will be advanced with a timing function with background music and overlays in the future.

New things you will learn:
1) How to flip a card.
2) How to check if two cards get matched.
3) How to lock the board so that we cant access cards when checking for two cards.
4) How to shuffle the cards.

1) I used the "Grid" property to create the 4X4 for cards you can use the "Flex" property also.
2) IIFE- Immediately invoked function expression is used on the (shuffle function).
3) Destructuring Assignment is used in resetBoard function.
4) Ternary Operator is used in matchChecking.
